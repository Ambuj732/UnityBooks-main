                    We reserve the right to modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for
                    example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms
                    regularly.
                    If a revision is a material, we will try to provide at least 14 days notice prior to any new terms
                    taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
                </p>

                <p class="pbox">
                    We'll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We'll post notice of modified
                    additional
                    terms in the applicable service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no
                    sooner than seven days after posting. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or
                    changes
                    made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for
                    a
                    Service, you should discontinue your use of that service.
